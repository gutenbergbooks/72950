<h2><em>A Change of Air</em><br>
<em>Chapter I</em></h2>


<p>One day Mr. Bunnikins-Bunny
came home feeling very much out of
sorts. He had a headache, a toothache,
and the shivery-shivers all over.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bunny gave him some cayenne
pepper tea, and then put him
to bed well wrapped up in blankets,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
and with a hot-water bottle to keep
his toe-toes warm. Very funny he
looked with his long ears sticking
out of his blue-and-white nightcap.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_008" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_008.jpg" alt="Bunnies playing on floor">
</figure>
<br>

<p>In the afternoon, his friend, Mr.
Gray-Squirrel, dropped in to see him,
and said at once:
“What you need
is a change of air,
and I know just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
the thing for you to do; come for a
trip to the Moon with me in my
new airship. You’ll have plenty of
fresh air, and not too much heat,
unless we happen to fall into the
Sun.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no!” cried poor Mrs.
Bunnikins-Bunny, almost in tears.
“I simply cannot let Mr. Bunnikins
go sailing in the air. He would
surely fall out of the ship, or get
lost in the clouds, and I should never
see him any more.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Bunnikins liked the idea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
and at once set his heart on going.
He talked so much about it, that at
last Mrs. Bunny consented, if she and
the children might go too, so that
they could all fall out of the airship
together.</p>

<p>As Mr. Gray-Squirrel had told
them that the journey would be
very cold, Mr. Bunnikins-Bunny had
a great time buying ulsters and overshoes,
caps and mittens. Most of
his lovely hats he decided to leave
at home, as he was afraid they might
be blown away.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>By the end of a week, they were
all ready to start, Bobtail and Rosamund,
Ruddy and Chippie having
scarcely slept for nights from excitement.</p>

<p>The airship was most comfortably
arranged with nice little cabins in
which to eat and sleep, and the sides
were so high that no one could possibly
fall over the edge.</p>

<p>Mr. Gray-Squirrel had hired Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
Hawk to steer the airship by
day, and Admiral Owl to keep a
careful lookout at night. The children
were rather afraid of Captain
Hawk with his bright eyes and sharp
beak, but they all loved to talk to
old Admiral Owl, although he was
always very sleepy when the sun was
shining.</p>

<h2><em>Above the Clouds</em><br>
<em>Chapter II</em></h2>

<p>One fine morning away they flew,
circling round and round, up and up,
until the earth lay far below. Numbers
of strange birds flew about them,
and one big gray one, with long
feathery ears and a huge beak, frightened
little Rosamund dreadfully, by
perching on the airship close beside
her. Day after day, they sailed past
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>beautiful stars and planets, until one
morning they came to a very large
cluster of star islands, which were
thickly covered with herds of snow-white
cows.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_014" style="max-width: 52.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_014.jpg" alt="Three cows">
</figure>
<br>

<p>“Those cows belong to the King
of the Moon,” said Captain Hawk,
“and they give so much milk that the
islands are called The Milky Way.
We are not far from the Moon
now.”</p>

<p>That same day, towards evening,
they came to a great round island
entirely made of rocks and ice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>“Let’s not stop here,” said Mr.
Bunnikins-Bunny with a shiver. “It
is so cold that I think the tip of my
left ear is frozen.”</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp35" id="i_016" style="max-width: 24.1875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_016.jpg" alt="Bunny walking">
</figure>

<p>“But this is the
Island of the Moon,”
exclaimed Admiral
Owl, blinking his
round eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, how I wish
that I had stayed
at home,” groaned poor Mr. Bunnikins.
“Mrs. Bunny did not want to
come anyhow, and now we shall all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
freeze into icicles. Oh dear! Oh
dear!”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said his kind little
wife. “We will wrap up warmly,
and perhaps we shall have some
sleighing.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, when they landed,
they found a nice sleigh, drawn by
four reindeer, ready to carry them to
the hotel. In spite, however, of
wearing two ulsters, fur-lined overshoes,
a big muff, and a fur cap tied
down under his chin, Mr. Bunnikins-Bunny’s
whiskers, which were all you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
could see of him, fairly shook with
the cold.</p>
<br>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_018.jpg" alt="Cold bunnies">
</figure>
<br>

<p>The hotel was all
made of ice, so that
everybody outside
could see inside, and
everybody inside could see outside.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>It was well heated, and there were
warm carpets on the floors, but Mr.
Bunnikins would not be comforted.
He sat in a big arm-chair close to the
fire, with his toe-toes drawn up under
him, shivering and groaning.</p>
<br>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_019.jpg" alt="Cold bunny">
</figure>
<br>

<p>They had a very queer supper of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
dried potato-pie, dried apple dumpling,
and dried lettuce and carrot-cake,
for as nothing grows on the
cold Island of the Moon, everything
to eat has to be brought a long distance
in airships, and it all dries up
on the way.</p>
<br>

<h2><em>The Island of the Moon</em><br>
<em>Chapter III</em></h2>

<p>As Mr. Bunnikins-Bunny
was very anxious to see the
Moon King and his beautiful Palace,
they all started out the next morning
to visit him. At first they were
told that they could not see the King,
as he slept all day and was very busy
all night, but finally they were invited
to come to the Palace that evening,
at eight o’clock.</p>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_022" style="max-width: 49.375em;">

</figure>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>They spent the rest of the day
sleighing and seeing the island. The
houses were all made of ice, and
there were no trees, no flowers, not
even a blade of grass. The people
were so huge that they terrified the
children, and Rosamund kept tight
hold of her father’s paw.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_024" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_025.jpg" alt="Bunny in suit">
</figure>
<br>

<p>No Bunnies or Squirrels had ever
been seen in the Moon before, and
the people admired them very much.
One little giant girl cried tears as big
as dollars, because she could not keep
Rosamund for a plaything, and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
she picked her up in her big hands to
pet her, the poor little bunny was
frightened almost to death.
As soon as he had eaten
his supper, Mr. Bunnikins-Bunny
hurried
off to dress for the Moon King’s
Party. He tried one thing and then
another, until poor Mrs. Bunnikins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
was quite tired out trying to help
him, and thought he never would
be ready in time. At last he decided
to wear a beautiful
blue velvet suit
embroidered in gold,
and a very fine green
and white hat all
trimmed with ostrich<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
feathers. To keep himself warm, he
had a velvet cape lined with fur, and,
as a finishing touch, he wore a little
gold sword. Mrs. Bunnikins advised
him not to, as she was afraid it would
be in his way, but Mr. Bunnikins-Bunny
insisted that a sword was the
proper thing to wear at Court.</p>

<p>Bobtail and Ruddy Squirrel had
tied bright red bows on themselves
wherever they could find a place, and
Rosamund shouted with laughter
whenever she looked at them.</p>

<h2><em>The Palace<br>
of the<br>
Moon King</em><br>
<em>Chapter IV</em></h2>

<p>The Palace was made entirely
of blocks of ice most beautifully
carved, the walls being lined with
silk, so that nobody could look
in. It was brilliantly lighted, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
on each of the broad steps stood a
giant soldier, in scarlet and gold uniform.</p>

<p>Two big footmen led the Bunnikins-Bunnies
and the Gray-Squirrels
through one grand room after another,
until they came to a great
silver door, on which one of the footmen
knocked twice with a silver
wand. As the door slowly opened,
the Bunnikins-Bunnies and the Gray-Squirrels
were so dazzled by the flood
of light, that for a moment they all
covered their faces with their paws.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
Then they looked up and saw the
most wonderful room.</p>

<p>It was made of purest white ice,
the floors being covered with great
white rugs, and the walls with silvery
silk. The furniture was of ivory inlaid
with silver, and in every corner
stood a tall silver vase full of moon
flowers, which perfumed the air.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_030" style="max-width: 52.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_030.jpg" alt="Moon in blanket">
</figure>
<br>

<p>At one end of the great room was
a silver throne, on which was seated a
gigantic figure clad in a misty white
garment, from which the silvery moonbeams
streamed out in every direction,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>so that the whole room was filled
with a shimmering light.</p>

<p>In front of the King was a great
round window through which he was
intently gazing. His head was quite
bald, his cheeks were fat, he had a big
mouth, and his eyes were very large
and round. As he turned with a
pleasant smile to greet the Bunnikins-Bunnies
and the Gray-Squirrels, they
were very much astonished to recognize
the Man in the Moon, whom
they had so often seen, sitting high
up in the sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>“Draw the cloud curtain,” he said
to one of the footmen, who at once
pulled a heavy gray curtain across the
great window. Then in a very gentle
voice for such a huge being, he added:
“Come forward my little people, I
am very glad to see you.”</p>
<br>

<h2><em>The King of the Moon</em><br>
<em>Chapter V</em></h2>

<p>As they came forward Mr. Gray-Squirrel
made a polite bow, and Mrs.
Bunny and Mrs. Squirrel made nice
little courtesies, but poor Mr. Bunnikins-Bunny,
in the middle of a most
elegant bow, got his legs so twisted
up with his sword, that he turned a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
complete somersault right into the
Moon King’s lap!</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_034" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_034.jpg" alt="Bunny doing a somersault">
</figure>
<br>

<p>“Never mind,” said the King, as he
kindly helped him to his feet, “accidents
<em>will</em> happen. Have a piece of
cheese?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>On the broad arm of the King’s
throne was a plate full of green
cheese, of which he took a large piece
himself, after offering it to the Bunnies
and the Squirrels.</p>

<p>“Do you make your own cheese?”
asked Mrs. Bunnikins-Bunny, as she
tasted it.</p>

<p>“It is made for me in the Milky
Way,” replied the Moon King. “No
cows have been allowed in the Moon,
since a very rude one jumped right
over my head many years ago.”</p>

<p>Just then there was a loud squeal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
of terror from the other end of the
room. Bobtail had found the queer
cheese so horrid, that he simply <em>could
not</em> eat it. He had wandered off,
hoping to find some
dark corner in which
to hide it, and had
stumbled into
a mouse trap, and been caught by the
leg.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_036" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_036.jpg" alt="Bunny caught in a mouse trap">
</figure>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“Dear! Dear!” said the King, as
they all ran to help poor Bobtail.
“I am so sorry, but you see mice like
cheese almost as much as I do, and
so I have to set traps everywhere.
Now you shall have a peep from my
Look-Out-Window,” he continued,
taking Bobtail by the paw.</p>

<p>Far, far below they could see the
great round earth looking like a little
ball, but it made them all so dizzy,
that they did not look very long.</p>

<p>“Do you never get sleepy?” asked
Mrs. Gray-Squirrel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>“Not very often,” answered the
Moon King. “There are times
when I can watch with one eye, and
then I have taught the other eye to
go to sleep.”</p>

<p>“I thought you had a dog?” said
Mr. Bunnikins-Bunny.</p>

<p>“I did have a very fine yellow dog,
but alas, I lost him long ago,” and the
King, with a sigh, wiped away a tear.
“His name was
Ebenezer, but we
called him Sneezer
for short, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
he was so fond of mouse patties flavored
with pepper, which made him
sneeze. He was always
chasing cats. One day
he heard one
miaow, and
jumping
on the ledge
of my Great
Window, he
slipped and fell out, I
don’t know where.</p>

<p>“Since then, however, so many yellow
dogs have been seen on the Island
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>of Sirius, that it is now called the Dog
Star, and I believe that Sneezer landed
there.”</p>

<p>While the King had been talking,
the children had crept behind the
cloud curtain to try and see the Dog
Star. Bobtail had leaned out so far
that he lost his balance, and would
have surely gone to join Sneezer,
had not one of the King’s footmen
grabbed him by his short tail.</p>

<p>As it was now late, the Bunnikins-Bunnies
and the Gray-Squirrels, after
thanking the King for his kindness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
said good-by, and the cloud curtain
being drawn back, the King of
the Moon gazed down once more
upon the sleeping earth.</p>

<h2><em>The Island of Mars</em><br>
<em>Chapter VI</em></h2>

<p>Early next morning, as soon as the
sun had risen and the King of the
Moon had gone to bed, the Bunnikins-Bunnies
and the Gray-Squirrels
went on board the airship, and
sailed off toward the Island of Mars.
The children begged Captain Hawk
to stop at the Dog Star and see
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>Sneezer, but neither Mr. Bunnikins
nor Mr. Gray-Squirrel was willing
to, as they were both very much
afraid of dogs.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p>After several days of cloud fogs
and contrary winds, they arrived at
the great Island of Mars. As they
came near the shore, they were astonished
to see two squatty little
men walking about on their heads
with their heels in the air. No
sooner had Bobtail and Ruddy Squirrel
landed, than they scampered off to
look at the funny men. When they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
came near them, however, they were
walking on their feet. They told
Bobtail that they could walk as
easily on one end as the other, and
so by changing they never were tired.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p>When Mr. Bunnikins-Bunny asked
the way to the nearest town, the little
men offered to go with them, as it
was not far off. The village looked
very pretty as they approached, surrounded
by fruit trees and gardens
of flowers, but the houses seemed
most peculiar. The doors were at
the top of the houses, the chimneys
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>smoked close to the ground, and the
people went into their homes by an
outside staircase. One of the little
men told Mr. Gray-Squirrel
that all the
houses in Mars were
built that way, and he
had never seen any
other kind.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>When they arrived at the hotel,
they were escorted to the front door
by the landlord, who hopped up the
outside staircase before them on his
head. They went into a big hall at
the top of the house, from which a
broad staircase led downstairs to the
upstairs rooms.</p>

<h2><em>The Upside-Down House</em><br>
<em>Chapter VII</em></h2>

<p>When the Bunnikins-Bunnies and
the Gray-Squirrels saw their bedrooms,
they did not know what to
do. The chandeliers stood up from
the floors, and in the corners were
little stairways leading up to the
ceilings on which all the furniture
was nicely arranged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Bunny wondered how she
should ever keep the children from
falling out of bed, while Mr. Bunnikins-Bunny
sat down on a corner of
the chandelier, and held his bewildered
head between his front paws.</p>

<p>“If we stay here long,” said he,
“I shall go crazy, and you will have
to keep me in a cage.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the children were racing
up and down the little stairways
and trying the beds and chairs on the
ceiling. It was quite easy for Ruddy
and Chippy Gray-Squirrel to hang<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
on, but it was very difficult for Bobtail
and Rosamund Bunny, and it
ended by Bobtail’s suddenly falling
right on top of
his father, who
thought that the
furniture was coming
down, and was
scared out of his
wits. Bobtail was
well scolded, and
after that he and
Rosamund were
forbidden to climb on the ceiling.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>The landlord was quite hurt that
they did not like his fine rooms, but
to please them, he at last promised to
put some beds on <em>his ceiling</em>, which
they called a floor.</p>

<p>After a good dinner, they went out
to walk, and everywhere they saw
the most curious sights. All the
houses and shops were built upside
down, and many of the people
walked that way.</p>

<p>They were good-natured, fat little
dwarfs, with big heads, long black
hair, and small, bright eyes. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
wore very gay clothes,—red, blue, and
yellow being their favorite colors,—and
Mr. Bunnikins’s fine hat and beautiful
clothes were immensely admired.
In fact the people crowded so closely
about the Gray-Squirrels and the
Bunnikins-Bunnies and admired them
so much, that at last Mr. Bunnikins
became frightened, and hurried them
all back to the hotel.</p>

<h2><em>Back to Earth</em><br>
<em>Chapter VIII</em></h2>

<p>In the middle of the night, Mr.
Gray-Squirrel woke up to find Mr.
Bunnikins-Bunny in his blue-and-white
nightcap, standing by his bedside,
with a lighted candle in his
paw.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked Mr.
Gray-Squirrel, sitting up in bed.</p>

<p>“Oh dear me!” groaned poor Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
Bunnikins-Bunny, “I can’t go to
sleep, for every time that I do, I
dream that the furniture is falling off
the ceiling, or that I am walking on
my head. Would you be willing to
leave this awful place before breakfast?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” replied Mr. Gray-Squirrel;
“I am ready to go whenever
you are.”</p>

<p>“Besides,” continued Mr. Bunnikins-Bunny,
“I think that the people
here are becoming much too fond of
us, and if we stay any longer, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
may not let us go away at all. I am
sure that I don’t wish to spend the
rest of my life walking on my head in
an upside-down house.”</p>
<br>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_057.jpg" alt="Bunny in bed">
</figure>
<br>

<p>They waked up Mrs. Bunny, Mrs.
Gray-Squirrel, and the children as
soon as it was light, and creeping
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>quietly up the big staircase, they stole
out of the house.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_058" style="max-width: 54.4375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_058.jpg" alt="Group of animals">
</figure>
<br>

<p>At each street corner, Mr. Bunnikins-Bunny
had a fresh scare, but
they met no one, and before the
people were stirring in the village,
they were safely on board the airship.</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind, I would
rather not stop at any more islands,”
said Mr. Bunnikins. “In fact, I
think I should like to go home.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gray-Squirrel was quite willing,
so down they went, circling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
round and round, lower and lower,
until at the end of the second day
they were close to the Earth.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>What a sigh of relief
Mr. Bunnikins-Bunny
gave as he set his
foot once more
on familiar
ground!</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p>As they said good-by, he thanked
Mr. Gray-Squirrel warmly, and
assured him that he had had a most
wonderful trip. But as they walked
towards home, he said to Mrs. Bunnikins:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
“Well, my dear, I have always
thought that I should like to be a
bird and fly in the air; but now,
I am quite contented to be myself,
and stay on the good old solid
Earth!”</p>
